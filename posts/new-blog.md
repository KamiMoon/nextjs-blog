I am currently rewriting my old <a href="www.erickizaki.com">www.erickizaki.com</a> site.

Old site <a href="https://github.com/KamiMoon/angular_full" target="_blank">code</a>: MEAN stack using AngularJS 1.x. It is ancient stuff from 2015 and was hosted on Heroku.

New site <a href="https://github.com/KamiMoon/nextjs-blog" target="_blank">code</a>: Next.js, React, & Markdown for now. It is hosted on Vercel.

So if this site does not look great at the moment or has super old info on it, then that is the reason. I haven't touched this site in years and it needs a rewrite.
